Calculator Challenge

Your challenge is to put everything I've learned in both Module 1 and Module 2 to the test by designing and building my own full functioning calculator using HTML, CSS / SCSS, BEM and JavaScript.

The calculator should accept multiply inputs, do some calculations and give an output, it should also be a Mobile First Approach.
